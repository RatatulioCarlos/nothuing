Improved darkin.wtf with reach
I did some color changes, actually made the 2nd tab usable (LOL)
The code for darkin.wtf is really dogshit so i did some little changes
Reach works fine, pretty much instant just go on a practice server and hit a few people
You can use this for selling clients, idrc just credit this repository.
